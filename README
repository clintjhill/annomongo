Annotated Java for mongoDB

This is a simple library that allows you to create simple Java classes (POJO)
that are annotated in a mongoDB fashion. It provides a database wrapper to
the mongoDB Java driver as well.

@Collection
Assigned to a class and allows for the collection to be named or will assume
the name of the class.

@Field
Assigned to a public field and allows for naming or assumes field name.

@Get
Assigned to a method (currently forces a getter) and allows naming or assumes
method name (dropping the "get").

@Put
Assigned to a method (currently forces a setter) and allows naming or assumes
method name (dropping the "set").

Examples to come soon.
